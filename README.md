Introduction
This code is a simple implementation of a neural network using the Python library Tensorflow. The network is designed to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) using the popular MNIST dataset.

Requirements
Tensorflow 2.x
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
Usage
Clone or download the repository.
Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed (listed in the "Requirements" section).
Run the script using a command line interface or a Python IDE.
The script will automatically download the MNIST dataset and begin training the model.
The script will also provide visualizations of the model's performance during training, including accuracy and loss over time.
The trained model will be saved in a file called "mnist_model.h5" in the project directory.
Customization
The script includes several parameters that can be modified to customize the model's behavior:

batch_size: the number of images to use in each training iteration.
epochs: the number of times the model will iterate over the entire dataset during training.
learning_rate: the rate at which the model will adjust its weights during training.
By default these are set to batch_size=128, epochs=10 and learning_rate=0.001 respectively.

Conclusion
This code is intended to serve as a simple example of how to implement a neural network using Tensorflow. It can be modified and extended to solve other image classification problems or used as a starting point for a more complex machine learning project.
